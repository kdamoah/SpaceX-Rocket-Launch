# IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Capstone-Project
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of USD62 million whereas other providers cost upward of USD165 million. Much of the savings is as a result of SpaceX reusing the first stage. Therefore, in the project, I predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Using `logistic regression`, `support vector machine`, and `decision tree classifier` machine learning algorithms, there is an **83.33%** accuracy that Falcon 9 rocket launch lands successfully.

The following were the tasks for the project in python:

- Data collection using APIs
- Web scraping
-	Data wrangling
-	Exploring data analysis with SQL
-	Exploring data analysis for data visualization using pandas and matplotlib libraries
-	Interactive visual analytics with folium library
-	Interactive dashboards with plotly dash library
-	Machine learning for predictive analysis
